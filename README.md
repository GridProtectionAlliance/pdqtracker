# PDQ Tracker

The PDQ Tracker administered by the Grid Protection Alliance (GPA) is a high-performance, real-time data processing engine designed to raise alarms, track states, store statistics, and generate reports on both the availability and accuracy of streaming synchrophasor data. PDQ Tracker will work with any vendorâ€™s PDC and synchrophasor data infrastructure; measure and automatically produce periodic reports on phasor data completeness and correctness; alarm and/or create emails in real-time if data quality problems are detected.

The purpose of PDQ Tracker is (1) to measure phasor data quality, (2) to disseminate data quality information to assure data quality awareness and facilitate data quality problem resolution, and (3) to provide a platform that can be extended to provide comprehensive data quality analytics including phasor data correction. See: [PDQTracker High Level Requirements](http://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/docs/products/PDQTracker/highlevelrequirements.pdf).
